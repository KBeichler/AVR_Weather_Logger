General infos


OPERATION MODES
    after power upo (VDD > 1,8V) it takes 10ms to start the device

    power down mode
        is entered when PWR_UP in CONFIG is LOW

    standby mode I   (low power)
        when PWR_UP in CONFIG is HIGH
        device returns to this mode when CE is switched LOW
    
    standy mode II
        when CE is held HIGH
    

        RX mode 
        PRIM_RX set 1 + CE high
        module receives data
            if dta found, its placed in the RX FIFO
        rx detect mode -> appendix E p74

        TX mode
        PRIM_RX set 0 + Payload in RX FIFO + at least 10us pulse on CE 
        stays until finished transmission
        if TX FIFO nit empoty, it transmits nex tpackage
        if FIFO empty -> standby II
        NEVER STAY IN RX MODE OVER 4MS!!

GENERAL CONFIG
    AIR DATA RATE
        is set by RF_DR in RF_SETUP

    RF CHANNEL
        RF_CH register by formula F=2400+RF_CH [MHz]

    PA CONTROL (send power)
        RF_PWR in RF_SETUP
        bit db  power  
        11   0   11,3ma
        10  -6   9
        01  -12  7,5
        00  -18   7

    LNA GAIN (power save but less sensitivity)
    LNA_HCURR in RF_SETUP

    RX/TX set
    by PRIM_RX in CONFIÖG


ENHANCED SHOCKBURST
    
    Packet structure
    Preamble    5byte adress    Control fiel        Payload     CRC
    0101...                     payload length PID

    Static or Dynamic Paylpad length
        static ist default
            set in RX_PW_Px registers on receiver shifte
            on RX side its just de bytes clocked int RX FIFO
        
        Dynamic length DPL
            enables varaible lengths. the controller can read the received payload in the R_RX_PL_WID register.
            to enable: EN_DPL in FEATURE must be set.
                        in RX the DYNPD has to be set
                        in TX DPL_P= in DYNPD has to be set
        
    Packet assembly
        adress is taken from TX_ADDR (length of addres set with AW register)
        NO ACK can be set?
        RX is searchingfor packets with its adresses from RX_ADDR

        afer assembly the RX_DR IRQ is toggled
    
    Auto Packet Handling
        Auto ACK
            sends ACK from RX to TX after successful rx. enabled in EN_AA
            when DPL is active, the ACK can contain a playoad
                mus be uploaded in W_ACK_PAYLOAD. ACK payload is pending until new rx is received
        
        Auto retransmit
            retransmits if no ACK received. is set with ARC in SETUP_RETR register.
            when ack is received, TX_IDS IRQ is toggled.
            is done regardles if CE pin, PWR_DOWN cancles retransmit
            Can be minotred with ARC_CNT and PLOS_CNT in OBSERVE_TX register.

    Enable RX CHANNEL   
        can receive from up tto 6 channels.
        they are activated in EN_RXADDR (default is pipe 0 and 1)
            adresses are set in RX_ADDR_PX
        Pipe 0 has uniqe adresse   
        Pipe 1-5 share 4 MSbytes

INTERFACE SPECS
    IRQ - sends out up to 3 interrupts
    CE enables chip in TX or RX mode
    4 MOSI LINES

    SPI COMMUNICATION
    every com hast to start by CSN to LOW
    STATUS register will be shifted out by the module ond first command byte
    Command Format:
        COMMAND word + Data Bytes

    SPI commands
    
FIFOS
    TX three level 32byte FIFO
    RX three level 32byte FIFO
    every FIFO holds up packets for up to 3 Receivers
